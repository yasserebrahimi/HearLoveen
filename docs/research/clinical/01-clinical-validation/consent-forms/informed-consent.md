We are conducting this study to find out if using the HearLoveen mobile application (along with regular speech therapy) helps children with hearing impairment improve their speech skills better than speech therapy alone.

**What is HearLoveen?**
HearLoveen is a mobile app that:
- Records your child's speech practice at home
- Uses artificial intelligence to give immediate feedback
- Makes practice fun with games and rewards
- Shows you reports about your child's progress

- ✅ Have been diagnosed with hearing impairment (mild to moderate)
- ✅ Have been receiving speech therapy for at least 3 months
- ✅ Have access to a smartphone or tablet at home
- ✅ Speak English as their primary language

Your child may NOT be eligible if they:

### Randomization (Assignment to Groups)
Your child will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to either:
